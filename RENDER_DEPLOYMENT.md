# Render Deployment Guide

## Updated Solution for YouTube IP Blocking (August 2025)

This API has been optimized for cloud deployment platforms like Render. The original Tor proxy approach doesn't work on cloud platforms, so we've implemented a better solution.

## What's Fixed

‚úÖ **Removed Tor dependency** - No more connection refused errors  
‚úÖ **Added intelligent retry logic** - Multiple attempts with different strategies  
‚úÖ **Better error handling** - Clear messages when YouTube blocks the IP  
‚úÖ **Test endpoint** - Easy way to verify deployment works  

## Deployment Steps for Render

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Render
2. **Set build command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (but our project uses UV, so it auto-detects)
3. **Set start command**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app`
4. **Set environment variables**:
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Any random string for Flask sessions

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
```

### 2. Built-in Test
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/test
```
This uses a known working video to test if YouTube is blocking your server's IP.

### 3. Real Transcript
```bash
curl "https://your-app.onrender.com/transcript?videoId=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```

## Expected Behavior on Cloud Platforms

- ‚úÖ **Some videos work**: The retry logic helps with intermittent blocks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Some videos fail**: YouTube actively blocks cloud provider IPs
- üîÑ **Inconsistent results**: Same video might work one time, fail another

## Error Responses

### IP Blocked (503)
```json
{
  "error": "IP blocked by YouTube",
  "message": "YouTube has blocked requests from this server IP...",
  "suggestion": "Try again later or use a different video ID"
}
```

### Video Not Found (404)
```json
{
  "error": "No transcript found",
  "message": "No transcript is available for this video"
}
```

## Alternative Solutions

If YouTube blocking is still too problematic:

1. **Different hosting provider**: Try AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions
2. **Proxy service**: Use a residential proxy service
3. **Client-side approach**: Move the YouTube API calls to frontend JavaScript
4. **YouTube Data API**: Use official YouTube Data API v3 (requires API key, has quotas)

## Architecture Notes

The new implementation:
- Tries multiple language codes across retry attempts
- Uses progressive delays to avoid rate limiting  
- Provides detailed error classification
- Works better than Tor proxy approach on cloud platforms
